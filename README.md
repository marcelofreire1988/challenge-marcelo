# Docker Challenge Marcelo Fernandes!

For this challenge, I used an image from nginx as it is a light, fast and scalable web server, containing many configuration possibilities.

For scalability of this application, decide to use a **docker swarm** to provide high availability and ease of management.

The provisioning the instance was create using **terraform**.

The automation for install docker and deploy the application with **ansible**.
