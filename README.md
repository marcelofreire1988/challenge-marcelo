# Docker Challenge Marcelo Fernandes!

For this challenge, I used an image from nginx as it is a light, fast and scalable web server, containing many configuration possibilities.

For orchestration scalability of this application, decide to create a **swarm cluster** to provide high availability and ease of management.

The provisioning of these instances was create using **terraform**.

The automation for install docker and start the swarm cluster with **ansible**.
