# Docker Challenge Marcelo Fernandes!

For this challenge, I used an image from nginx as it is a light, fast and scalable web server, containing many configuration possibilities.

For scalability of this application, i decided to use a **docker swarm** to provide high availability and ease of management.

The provisioning of the instance was created using **terraform**.

The automation for install docker and deploy the application with **ansible**.
